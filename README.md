## Overview

JARVIS is a virtual assistant web application that uses voice commands to perform various tasks such as opening web pages and local applications. The assistant responds to voice commands, greets the user based on the time of day, and can execute a variety of commands including opening Google, YouTube, Facebook, and several local applications on your PC.

## Features

- Voice recognition using the Web Speech API.
- Text-to-speech responses.
- Opens popular websites.
- Opens local applications on your PC (e.g., Calculator, Notepad, Paint).
- Greets the user based on the time of day.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end.
- Python (Flask) for the back-end to handle opening local applications.
- Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mszaffari/jarvis-virtual-assistant.git
    cd jarvis-virtual-assistant
    ```

2. Set up the Python environment and install dependencies:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Python Flask server:
    ```sh
    python app_opener.py
    ```

4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask server**:
    Make sure the Flask server is running by executing `python app_opener.py`. This server listens for commands to open local applications.

2. **Open the HTML file**:
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This is the main interface of the virtual assistant.

3. **Interact with JARVIS**:
    Click the microphone button and give voice commands such as:
    - "Open Google"
    - "Open YouTube"
    - "Open Facebook"
    - "Open Calculator"
    - "Open Notepad"
    - "Open Paint"

    JARVIS will respond to your commands and open the respective applications or websites.
